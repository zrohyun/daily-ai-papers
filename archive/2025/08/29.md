| Computer Vision | Pref-GRPO: Pairwise Preference Reward-based GRPO for Stable
  Text-to-Image Reinforcement Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20751) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20751))| Jiazi Bu, Yujie Zhou, Zhimin Li, yuhangzang, CodeGoat24 | This paper introduces Pref-GRPO, a novel pairwise preference reward-based GRPO method for stable text-to-image reinforcement learning. The research addresses the problem of reward hacking in existing pointwise RM-based GRPO methods due to illusory advantage. The method reformulates the GRPO optimization objective from absolute reward score maximization to pairwise preference fitting using a pairwise preference RM. Experiments show that Pref-GRPO achieves a 5.84% increase in overall score on UNIGENBENCH compared to UR-based methods. Pref-GRPO offers more stable advantages than pointwise scoring, mitigating reward hacking problems and enhancing T2I generation stability. |

  Instruction-Driven Routing & Sparsification (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21046) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.21046))| Liqiang Nie, Jie He, Rui Shao, Renshan Zhang, Wei Li | The paper introduces CogVLA, a novel Vision-Language-Action model, to enhance efficiency and performance by instruction-driven routing and sparsification. The research aims to address the computational overhead and semantic degradation prevalent in VLMs by incorporating a 3-stage architecture inspired by human multimodal coordination. CogVLA employs Encoder-FiLM based Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing), LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing), and V-L-A Coupled Attention (CAtten) for progressive visual sparsification and cross-modal alignment. Experimental results on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with a 97.4% success rate and a 2.8x reduction in inference latency compared to OpenVLA.

  Tasks via MCP Servers (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20453) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20453))| Shashank Biju, Hemani Patel, Qi Chang, Zhenting Wang, ankits0052 | The paper introduces MCP-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in tool-use scenarios involving realistic, multi-step tasks. MCP-Bench leverages 28 Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers spanning 250 tools across diverse domains, such as finance and scientific computing, to test LLMs' ability to perform tool retrieval, cross-tool coordination, and complex planning. Experiments on 20 advanced LLMs reveal persistent challenges, with top-performing models achieving overall scores of around 0.75, while smaller models lag behind due to weaker dependency awareness and parallelism. The benchmark aims to address limitations in existing tool-use evaluations, which often rely on explicit tool specifications and isolated domain operations, offering a standardized platform for assessing agentic reasoning and tool-use capabilities. |

  Preference Learning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21066) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.21066))| Yitong Wang, Shiyin Wang, Yuan Gong, wujie10, XionghuiWang | The paper introduces OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning framework for improving mask-guided image generation across multiple tasks. It addresses the challenge of training versatile image editing models by using a single vision-language model (VLM) as a generative reward model, facilitating multi-task learning without task-specific fine-tuning. The key methodology involves directly optimizing a pre-trained base model via multi-task reinforcement learning, guided by the VLM-based reward. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to commercial and open-source alternatives, with Seedream 3.0 Fill achieving a usability rate of 69.04% on image fill. The framework's unified approach simplifies training and enhances generalization for image editing tasks, implying a more efficient route for developing versatile image generation models. |
| Natural Language Processing | Turning the Spell Around: Lightweight Alignment Amplification via
  Rank-One Safety Injection (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20766) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20766))| Bernard Ghanem, George Turkiyyah, Hasan Abed Al Kader Hammoud, Harethah Abu Shairah | The paper introduces RANK-One SafetY INJECTION (ROSI), a lightweight method to enhance safety alignment in LLMs. It investigates whether safety can be systematically amplified by steering activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace.

Chen, Zhengyuan Liu, Daniel Wai Kit Chin, Incomple | The paper introduces DuET-PD, a framework for evaluating and enhancing robustness and adaptability of LLMs in persuasive dialogues. It investigates how LLMs balance gullibility to misinformation and resistance to valid corrections in knowledge and safety domains. The methodology involves multi-turn stance-change dialogues with positive/corrective and negative/misleading persuasion, evaluated using MMLU-Pro and SALAD-Bench. Results show GPT-4o achieves only 27.32% accuracy in MMLU-Pro under misleading persuasion, and concerning sycophancy in newer models. To address this, they introduce Holistic DPO, improving Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct's safety accuracy from 4.21% to 76.54%, offering a pathway to more reliable and adaptable LLMs. |

  Dialogue with Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21061) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.21061))| Alex Endert, Eunyee Koh, Shunan Guo, Adam Coscia | The paper introduces OnGoal, an LLM chat interface that tracks and visualizes conversational goals to help users manage goal progress. It investigates how to enhance a linear chat interface to aid users in evaluating and reviewing their conversational goals during LLM interactions. The study employs a three-stage LLM-assisted goal pipeline for inferring, merging, and evaluating user goals. A user study with 20 participants shows that OnGoal reduced time and effort in achieving goals, leading to increased engagement and resilience. This suggests that tracking and visualizing goals can enhance user interaction in complex LLM dialogues, implying that future interfaces should improve goal communication and reduce cognitive load. |

The research aims to provide a benchmark dataset and analysis for partial deepfake detection due to the limitations of existing benchmarks. FakePartsBench, a large-scale dataset comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level annotations, is presented to facilitate comprehensive evaluation. Results from user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, while similar degradation is observed in state-of-the-art detection models. The study underscores the vulnerability of current deepfake detection methods to partial manipulations and offers resources for developing more robust defenses. |
| Natural Language Processing | Provable Benefits of In-Tool Learning for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20755) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2508.20755))| Vivien Cabannes, Charles Arnal, Ambroise Odonnat, Sam Houliston | This paper explores the theoretical benefits of in-tool learning (external retrieval) compared to in-weight learning (memorization) for large language models (LLMs). The research investigates the most efficient method for LLMs to acquire and utilize knowledge, questioning whether facts should be internalized or accessed externally. The study uses theoretical lower and upper bounds, along with circuit constructions, validated by controlled experiments where tool-using models outperform memorizing ones. The results show that in-weight memorization is fundamentally limited by parameter count, while tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via efficient circuit construction, further supported by experiments showing teaching tool-use is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. The findings suggest that tool-augmented workflows are provably more scalable for LLMs, offering a path to open-ended knowledge access and generalization. |

It addresses the scarcity of 3D training data by integrating information from RGB images, RGBD data, and point clouds using modality-specific encoders and a shared decoder. The framework incorporates 2D and 3D supervision, along with a triplane latent diffusion model, to enhance texture and geometry. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate TriMM achieves competitive performance, with a PSNR of 27.81 on Objaverse dataset using RGB data, compared to state-of-the-art methods that rely on larger datasets. TriMM offers a promising pathway to address the challenge of 3D training data scarcity by effectively leveraging multi-modal information. |
