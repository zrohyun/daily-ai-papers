  Representations (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02587) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.02587))| Konstantinos Karydis, Divyank Shah, Justin Yue, Jerry Li, Yewandou | The paper introduces BEVCALIB, a novel target-less LiDAR-camera calibration method using bird's-eye view (BEV) representations. It aims to improve calibration accuracy by explicitly enforcing geometric constraints during the calibration process. The methodology involves extracting and fusing camera and LiDAR BEV features, followed by a geometry-guided feature selection and refinement process. Evaluations on KITTI and NuScenes datasets show that BEVCALIB outperforms the best baseline by an average of (47.08%, 82.32%) on KITTI dataset in terms of (translation, rotation), respectively. The approach provides AI practitioners with a new state-of-the-art method that enhances multi-modal sensor fusion in autonomous systems. |
| Computer Vision | PATS: Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling for Multi-View Sports Skill
  Assessment (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04996) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.04996))| Antonio Liotta, EdBianchi | The paper introduces Proficiency-Aware Temporal Sampling (PATS) for improved multi-view sports skill assessment. It addresses the disruption of temporal continuity in existing video sampling methods by preserving complete fundamental movements within continuous temporal segments. PATS adaptively segments videos to maximize information coverage while maintaining temporal coherence, enhancing multi-view fusion. Evaluated on the EgoExo4D benchmark, PATS improves state-of-the-art accuracy by +0.65% to +3.05% across viewing configurations. This adaptive temporal sampling approach advances automated skill assessment in real-world applications by capturing more coherent and meaningful temporal patterns. |
| Natural Language Processing | What do self-supervised speech models know about Dutch? Analyzing
  advantages of language-specific pre-training (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00981) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00981))| Willem Zuidema, Gaofei Shen, Charlotte Pouw, Hosein Mohebbi, Marianne de Heer Kloots | This paper investigates language-specific speech representations in self-supervised models by analyzing Dutch phonetic and lexical encoding. The study examines the impact of pre-training Wav2Vec2 models exclusively on Dutch compared to English and multilingual data. The methodology involves training and evaluating phone and word identity probes, ABX tasks, clustering, and representational similarity analysis on the SSL-NL dataset. Results show that Dutch-specific pre-training improves Dutch linguistic feature encoding, reflected by enhanced probe accuracy and lower word error rates on ASR tasks. The findings suggest that language-specific pre-training enhances linguistic representation in speech models, which benefits downstream ASR performance, and highlights the importance of data selection and analysis methods. |
