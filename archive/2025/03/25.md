  Large Language Models via Sparse Autoencoders (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18878) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18878))| Polina Druzhinina, Andrey Galichin, tlenusik, razzant, therem | This paper explores the internal reasoning mechanisms of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). The main research objective is to identify and interpret the features within LLMs that drive reasoning capabilities. The key methodology involves employing SAEs to learn a sparse decomposition of LLM activations, then introducing a metric called ReasonScore to identify reasoning-relevant features and validating these features through empirical analysis, interpretability methods and causal interventions (steering). Steering identified reasoning features resulted in consistent performance improvement across multiple reasoning benchmarks (up to 14% increase on the GPQA Diamond dataset); for example, steering the feature at index i=46379 leads to an increase of the number of token on 29% for AIME 2024. The main implication for AI practioners is they can use the method for systematically enhancing and interpreting reasoning performance in LLMs. |
| Computer Vision | Position: Interactive Generative Video as Next-Generation Game Engine (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17359) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.17359))| XihuiLiu, dizhang, Xintao, chehx, VictorYuki | This position paper proposes Interactive Generative Video (IGV) as the core technology for next-generation Generative Game Engines (GGE), enabling unlimited and interactive content creation. The main research objective is to demonstrate how IGV can overcome limitations of traditional game engines, such as predetermined content and high development costs, by leveraging video generation capabilities. The key methodology involves a proposed GGE framework centered around IGV, incorporating five core modules: Generation, Control, Memory, Dynamics, and Intelligence, along with a GamePlay module. The paper outlines a hierarchical maturity roadmap (L0-L4) for GGE development, from manual asset creation to self-evolving world ecosystems, but does not appear to present quantitative performance metrics for their proposed system.

| Computer Vision | Video-T1: Test-Time Scaling for Video Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18942) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.18942))| Hanyang Wang, duanyueqi, xhangzhan, iseesaw, Liuff23 | This paper introduces Video-T1, a framework for improving video generation quality through test-time scaling (TTS). The main research question is how much video generation quality can be improved by allowing a model to use non-trivial amounts of inference-time computation, given a challenging text prompt. The key methodology reinterprets test-time scaling as a search problem, using test-time verifiers and heuristic algorithms (random linear search, Tree-of-Frames (ToF)) to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise. Experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements; for instance, using TTS with the CogVideoX-5B model increases its total VBench score from 81.61 to 84.42 (+3.44%). AI practitioners can leverage inference-time computation to achieve superior video generation results without the need for expensive model retraining. |

The research question focuses on mitigating the inaccuracies in velocity prediction during the early stages of training in flow matching models, which negatively impacts the performance of standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). The proposed method, CFG-Zero*, involves optimizing a scaling factor to correct velocity inaccuracies and implementing a "zero-init" technique that zeros out the initial steps of the ODE solver. Experiments on text-to-image and text-to-video generation using models like Lumina-Next, Stable Diffusion 3, and Wan-2.1 show that CFG-Zero* consistently outperforms standard CFG. For example, on ImageNet-256, CFG-Zero attained the highest Inception score of 258.87. For AI practitioners, CFG-Zero* offers a more robust and effective guidance mechanism that improves sample quality and text alignment without significant computational overhead. |
