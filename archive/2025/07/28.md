| Machine Learning | The Geometry of LLM Quantization: GPTQ as Babai's Nearest Plane
  Algorithm (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18553) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18553))| Dan Alistarh, Torsten Hoefler, softmax | This paper presents a geometric interpretation of GPTQ, a post-training quantization method for large language models. It aims to provide theoretical grounding for GPTQ by relating it to Babai's nearest plane algorithm for solving the closest vector problem (CVP) on lattices. The methodology involves mathematically demonstrating the equivalence between GPTQ and Babai's algorithm when executed back-to-front, under specific conditions. The primary result is the equivalence, which leads to inheriting Babai's error bound under the no-clipping condition, providing a formal guarantee for layer-wise quantization error. The implication for AI practitioners is the potential for leveraging decades of lattice algorithm research to design improved quantization methods for billion-parameter models. |
| Natural Language Processing | Deep Researcher with Test-Time Diffusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16075) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.16075))| Guan Sun, Lesly Miculicich, Zoey CuiZhu, Yanfei Chen, Rujun Han | The paper introduces Test-Time Diffusion Deep Researcher (TTD-DR), a novel framework for generating high-quality research reports by mimicking human iterative research. The research question explores improving the performance of deep research agents, especially for complex, long-form report generation. TTD-DR employs a diffusion process starting with a preliminary draft iteratively refined via retrieval-augmented denoising and a self-evolutionary algorithm for each agentic component. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks requiring intensive search and multi-hop reasoning, outperforming existing deep research agents by 69.1% win rate on LongForm Research tasks compared to OpenAI Deep Research. This enables more efficient and coherent report generation for AI practitioners. |
| Natural Language Processing | Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking
  Through Test-Time Refinement (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18742))| vicgalle | The paper addresses the issue of in-context reward hacking in large language models. It introduces Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a test-time framework where the model identifies and corrects flaws in its own guiding specification. SSC involves generating a response, critiquing it, and revising the specification to remove exploitable loopholes. Experiments on creative writing and agentic coding tasks showed that SSC reduces reward hacking by over 90%, while models initially gamed tainted specifications in 50-70% of cases. This method provides a way to improve alignment without modifying model weights, leading to more robustly aligned model behavior. |
| Computer Vision | PRIX: Learning to Plan from Raw Pixels for End-to-End Autonomous Driving (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17596) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.17596))| Patric Jensfelt, Yixi Cai, Lianhang Liu, maciejw94 | The paper presents PRIX, an end-to-end autonomous driving architecture that directly plans trajectories from raw pixel inputs without explicit BEV representation or LiDAR. PRIX introduces a Context-aware Recalibration Transformer (CaRT) to enhance multi-level visual features for robust planning. The method trains a diffusion model conditioned on visual features to predict safe trajectories. Experiments show PRIX achieves state-of-the-art performance on NavSim and nuScenes benchmarks, matching larger multimodal diffusion planners. Notably, PRIX achieves a PDMS of 87.8 on the NavSim-v1 benchmark while maintaining efficient inference speed, offering a practical solution for real-world deployment on camera-only vehicles. |
| Multi-Modal | Chat with AI: The Surprising Turn of Real-time Video Communication from
  Human to AI (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10510) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.10510))| Xinggong Zhang, Liming Liu, Zhiyuan Ren, keyonN | The paper introduces Artic, an AI-oriented real-time communication (RTC) framework that aims to reduce latency in AI Video Chat by shifting the network requirement from "humans watching video" to "AI understanding video". It addresses challenges in AI video chat where MLLM inference latency limits the time available for video streaming. Artic employs context-aware video streaming, which dynamically adjusts bitrate allocation based on chat context, and loss-resilient adaptive frame rate to minimize bitrate waste and packet retransmission, and presents DeViBench to evaluate the impact of video quality on MLLM accuracy. Experiments show that context-aware streaming reduces the bitrate by 50% while maintaining high MLLM accuracy (decrease from 0.93 to 0.87), indicating the potential for significantly lower-latency AI video communication. |
