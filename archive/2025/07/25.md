| Reinforcement Learning | Group Sequence Policy Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18071) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18071))| Bowen Yu, Xiong-Hui Chen, Mingze Li, Shixuan Liu, Chujie Zheng | The paper introduces Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), a novel RL algorithm designed for stable and efficient training of large language models. GSPO addresses instability issues in existing algorithms like GRPO by defining importance ratios based on sequence likelihood and performing sequence-level clipping, reward, and optimization. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GSPO outperforms GRPO in training stability, efficiency, and performance, especially for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, and it eliminates the need for complex stabilization strategies. The authors successfully applied GSPO to the latest Qwen3 models. This advancement can simplify RL infrastructure and enable the continued development of large language models. |
| Reinforcement Learning | LAPO: Internalizing Reasoning Efficiency via Length-Adaptive Policy
  Optimization (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15758) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.15758))| Linjuan Wu, Shangke Lyu, Xingyu Wu, tricktreat, yanyc | The paper introduces Length-Adaptive Policy Optimization (LAPO), a two-stage reinforcement learning framework designed to improve the efficiency of reasoning models by internalizing appropriate reasoning lengths. LAPO addresses the research question of enabling models to autonomously adjust their reasoning depth based on problem complexity rather than adhering to rigid constraints. The method involves a discovery stage to learn natural reasoning lengths through length-aware rewards and an internalization stage to embed these patterns as self-proposed budgets within the model's reasoning context. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9% while improving accuracy by 2.3%. LAPO allows AI practitioners to create more computationally efficient reasoning models capable of dynamically allocating resources based on problem-specific demands. |
| Natural Language Processing | MUR: Momentum Uncertainty guided Reasoning for Large Language Models (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14958) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.14958))| Jian Zhang, Yifei Li, Rongman Xu, Fangzhi Xu, Hang Yan | The paper introduces MUR, a novel approach to adaptively guide test-time scaling for large language models. It addresses the issue of overthinking by dynamically allocating thinking budgets based on a momentum-uncertainty metric. MUR tracks and aggregates step-wise uncertainty over time to enhance reasoning efficiency without additional training. Experimental results on MATH-500 and other benchmarks demonstrate that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by 0.62-3.37%. This allows practitioners to achieve a better trade-off between reasoning quality and computational cost for LLMs. |

  Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18537) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18537))| Yujie Wei, Shiwei Zhang, Yukang Chen, Ruihang Chu, Zhekai Chen | The paper introduces TTS-VAR, a novel test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR) models. It addresses the challenge of scaling visual generation models efficiently. The methodology incorporates an adaptive descending batch size schedule and integrates clustering-based diversity search at coarse scales with resampling-based potential selection at fine scales, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. Experiments on the Infinity VAR model show a notable 8.7% improvement in GenEval score (0.69 to 0.75). TTS-VAR offers AI practitioners a resource-efficient way to improve VAR model performance without extensive retraining, highlighting the impact of early-stage structural features on final image quality. |
| Computer Vision | Captain Cinema: Towards Short Movie Generation (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18634) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18634))| Yang Zhao, Shengqu Cai, Lvmin Zhang, Ceyuan Yang, Junfei Xiao | The paper introduces Captain Cinema, a framework for generating short movies from textual descriptions. It addresses the challenge of long-range coherence and visual consistency by using a top-down keyframe planning module followed by a bottom-up video synthesis module with interleaved training and a multimodal diffusion transformer (MM-DiT). The primary objective is to automate the creation of narrative-consistent and visually coherent short movies. Key to the approach is an interleaved training strategy and a memory mechanism called GoldenMem to compress long-context visual memory. Experiments demonstrate strong performance in long-form narrative video synthesis, achieving a high aesthetic quality score of 57.2 (VBench-2.0), implying the framework's capability to generate high-quality short movies exceeding existing approaches in duration and multimodal video generation. |

  Diffusion (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16535) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.16535))| Jing Wang, Wen Qian, Chaohui Yu, Chenjie Cao, ShuYaoLiu | The paper introduces EarthCrafter, a novel framework for scalable 3D Earth generation. It addresses the challenge of modeling vast geographic areas by decoupling structural and textural generation via dual-sparse latent diffusion. The methodology involves the creation of Aerial-Earth3D, a large-scale 3D aerial dataset, and employs dual-sparse VAEs for encoding geometric voxels and textural 2D Gaussian Splats, with Flow Matching diffusion models trained independently. EarthCrafter achieves significantly improved performance in large-scale generation (quantitative metrics unspecified, but improvements are mentioned). This framework facilitates versatile applications such as semantic-guided urban layout and unconditional terrain synthesis. |
| Reinforcement Learning | Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization for Adaptive Reasoning (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15844) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.15844))| Xingyu Wu, Linjuan Wu, tricktreat, yanyc, paradox122 | The paper introduces Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement learning framework for improving reasoning efficiency in large language models. HBPO addresses the exploration space collapse by partitioning rollout samples into budget-constrained hierarchies to learn problem-specific reasoning depths. The methodology employs differentiated reward mechanisms aligned with problem complexity to enable adaptive resource allocation. Experimental results demonstrate that HBPO reduces average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across four reasoning benchmarks. This suggests reasoning efficiency and capability can be simultaneously optimized through structured hierarchical training, allowing models to adapt computational effort to problem complexity. |
| Machine Learning | DriftMoE: A Mixture of Experts Approach to Handle Concept Drifts (Read more on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18464) or [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/papers/2507.18464))| Ricardo Sim√≥n Carbajo, Miguel Aspis, suarezcetrulo, sebasmos | DriftMoE is an online Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed for concept drift adaptation in non-stationary data streams. The paper addresses the challenge of adapting to concept drifts by proposing a symbiotic co-training framework between a compact neural router and a pool of incremental Hoeffding tree experts, which aims to optimize expert specialization. The key methodology involves a multi-hot correctness mask to refine router parameters and reinforce accurate experts to accelerate specialization. Results demonstrate competitive performance with state-of-the-art stream learning ensembles across nine benchmarks, with MoE-Data achieving strong performance on AIRL and LED streams, although performance on class-imbalanced data such as ELEC and COVT needs improvement. The implication is that DriftMoE provides a principled and efficient approach to concept drift adaptation, potentially offering a scalable alternative to large ensemble models. |
